## **Project Overview;**

Do you ever wish that your food would cook itself because it is too much of a trouble or you are too busy? Well, now this project aims to make that wish come true! (sort of). This project is a robot which takes aid from motion tracking cameras to watch you cook your favourite dishes, learns from your actions and then replicates them for you, helping you save time or overcome your disabilities! Unlike the usual cooking robot on the market, this model can learn from you and holds no limit to the dishes it can cook!

## **Objectives;**

- **Innovative Cooking Assistance:** Develop a robotic assistant that utilizes AI and motion tracking to learn and replicate user cooking techniques, enhancing the userâ€™s lifestyle.
- **User Customization:** Allow users to input and teach their own cooking preferences, ensuring the system is not limited to preset dishes.
- **Learning Capability:** Implement machine learning algorithms enabling the Culinary Companion to adapt and improve its cooking methods based on user feedback and observed practices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive interface that simplifies interaction with the Culinary Companion, making it accessible for all users.
- **Efficiency and Precision:** Enhance the cooking process's efficiency by optimizing ingredient use and cooking conditions such as flame heat and timing.

## **Scope of Work;**

**Phase 1: Research;**

Conduct comprehensive research on suitable hardware components, including mechanical arms for utensil handling and video cameras for motion tracking. This phase will also involve studying the limitations of colour identification and clarity in cameras to determine optimal colour schemes for utensils and ingredient containers to facilitate easy recognition.

**Phase 2: System Development;**

- Hardware Integration: Assemble mechanical arms with appropriate sensors and cameras capable of tracking user movements.
- Software Development: Create a software framework using Python that integrates machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow) for real-time learning from user actions.
- User Input System: Develop a module allowing users to input recipes and preferences, which the robot will learn from.

**Phase 3: Testing (1);**

- Testing Platform: Set up a kitchen environment equipped with the necessary hardware for testing.
- Test Data Collection**:** Observe users as they cook various dishes over a week, collecting data on their techniques for analysis.
- Initial Feedback Analysis: Evaluate how well the robot replicates cooking actions based on initial observations.

**Phase 4: Algorithm Training;**

- Training Scenarios: Simulate various cooking scenarios where users can provide feedback on the robot's performance.
- Adaptive Learning: Implement feedback loops allowing the robot to adjust its techniques based on user preferences and outcomes.

**Phase 5: Testing (2);**

- Refined Testing Environment: Utilize the kitchen setup from Phase 3 for further testing.
- User Interaction Trials: Conduct trials where users interact with the robot while it attempts to replicate their cooking techniques in real-time.

**Phase 6: Final Integration;**

- Integrate all hardware components with refined software. Ensure that the robot can seamlessly transition between tasks such as ingredient preparation, cooking, and serving based on user commands.

**Phase 7: Final Testing;**

- Conduct extensive testing of the fully integrated system in a real-world kitchen environment. Monitor performance in various cooking scenarios to ensure reliability, accuracy, and responsiveness.
