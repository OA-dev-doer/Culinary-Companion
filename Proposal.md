## **Project Overview;**

Do you ever wish that your food would cook itself because it is too much of a trouble or you are too busy? Well, now this project aims to make that wish come true! (sort of). This project is a robot which takes aid from motion tracking cameras to watch you cook your favourite dishes, learns from your actions and then replicates them for you, helping you save time or overcome your disabilities! Unlike the usual cooking robot on the market, this model can learn from you and holds no limit to the dishes it can cook!

## **Objectives;**

- **Innovative Cooking Assistance:** Develop a robotic assistant that utilizes AI and motion tracking to learn and replicate user cooking techniques, enhancing the userâ€™s lifestyle.
- **User Customization:** Allow users to input and teach their own cooking preferences, ensuring the system is not limited to preset dishes.
- **Learning Capability:** Implement machine learning algorithms enabling the Culinary Companion to adapt and improve its cooking methods based on user feedback and observed practices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive interface that simplifies interaction with the Culinary Companion, making it accessible for all users.
- **Efficiency and Precision:** Enhance the cooking process's efficiency by optimizing ingredient use and cooking conditions such as flame heat and timing.

## **Scope of Work;**

**Research;**

In the research phase of the project, we will identify suitable hardware for handling utensils and tracking motion, focusing on mechanical arms and video cameras. We will explore how well these cameras recognize colors and their clarity, as well as the challenges of identifying colors in low light. Our goal is to find the best color schemes for utensils and containers to improve recognition. The development team will also use documentation and expert advice to understand the necessary frameworks for implementing these technologies effectively.

**Development;**
- Software Development: Create a software framework using Python that integrates machine learning libraries for analyzing and learning from video footage.
- User Input System: Develop a module allowing users to input recipes and preferences, which the robot will learn from. Also enable the functionality of accessing a video camera for footage.
- Algorithm Training; Video footage of people cooking dishes sourced from social media will be input as training data.

## **Conclusion;**

The Culinary Companion project aims to transform home cooking by providing an intelligent robotic assistant capable of learning from its users. Through a structured approach encompassing research, development, testing, and integration phases, this innovative solution will enhance efficiency in meal preparation while accommodating diverse user needs. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project not only supports individual lifestyles but also promotes inclusivity in culinary experiences.
