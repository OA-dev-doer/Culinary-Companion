## Project Overview;
Do you ever wish that your food would cook itself because it is too much of a trouble or you are too busy? Well, now this project aims to make that wish come true! (sort of). This project is a robot which takes aid from motion tracking cameras to watch you cook your favourite dishes, learns from your actions and then replicates them for you, helping you save time or overcome your disabilities! Unlike the usual cooking robot on the market, this model can learn from you and holds no limit to the dishes it can cook!
