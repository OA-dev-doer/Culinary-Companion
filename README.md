## Project Overview;

The Culinary Companion is an innovative food-preparation assistant designed to revolutionize home cooking by utilizing advanced AI and motion tracking technology. The Culinary Companion learns from observing users as they prepare various dishes, enabling it to replicate cooking techniques, ingredient usage, and timing with precision. This project aims to create a robot that not only automates cooking tasks but also gives the user the freedom to add any of their own dishes to be prepared, and not be limited to a certain number of preset dishes.
